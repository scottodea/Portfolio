# Scott O'Dea Portfolio
https://scottodea.github.io
## Purpose
#### The purpose of this portfolio is to display important information about myself in a responsive and user-friendly manner. It will be periodically updated as my skills and projects become more advanced.
#### This portfolio is targeted at potential employers and clients.

## Functionality
* Utilising a combination of HTML,CSS and Javascript to distinguish portfolio and create a personable website
* Media queries scale website depending on viewing screen and hide/show hamburger menu instead of complete navbar
* A hamburger menu made with spans is used for displaying navbar on smaller screens
* A fixed background-image is used to create a parallax effect when scrolling
* Smooth-scrolling is enabled in the HTML tag of the CSS to allow for eased transitions between website sections
* Javascript is used to add a snowing effect on home-page as well as enabling the navbar to "stick" to the top of the screen when scrolling

## **Short answer Q&A**

### **Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today**
* 1980, The Ethernet standard was introduced.
The Stanford University Network was created, the first local area network that connected distant computers.
* 1981, CSNET is implemented to allow networking between academic institutions.
* 1982, The TCP/IP protocol suite is formalised, allowing for standardisation across the internet.
  The STMP is created, the first internet standard for electronic mail
* 1983, Domain name system is introduced
* 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the hypertext transfer protocol (http). 
   Http granted different computer networks access to the same websites through standardisation.
* 1991, The World Wide Web is released by CERN to the general public.
* 1993 NCSA Mosaic was released, a graphical browser which went on to run on personal computers. 
It was the first browser of it's kind to display text and images on the same page.
Allowing non-technical users a multimedia experience.
* 1994, The first search-engines appear. This allows for easier navigation on the web to find content.
* 1999, IEEE 802.11 standards are adopted as the main specifications for implementing wireless local area networks

### **Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers**

Browsing through the internet is possible thanks to several technologies working harmoniously. Each device using the internet has an IP address, ie. a unique identifier. This is like an address, or ID, but unfortunately, it isn’t very readable for humans due to it being a string of numeric digits. Dynamic Name Servers(DNS) were created for this purpose. The DNS can translate a readable domain name (such as google.com) into an IP address, and a request is then sent to the server. 
The server and your device communicate by breaking the data into “packets”. These packets contain important information, about where the data came from and where it is going, like a letter. These packets arrive separately but are then complied together so web browsers can display the data from the server (pictures, HTML, files) in it’s intended format to the user.
 


### **Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today**
The creation of the World Wide Web has enriched nearly every aspect of human communication. Since it’s genesis in 1991, the WWW has allowed for a global network linking individuals, businesses, and economies together. This connectivity has allowed for things once not possible. 
Individuals can use the WWW to communicate with people from all around the world, finding people with the same passions and interests. Difficult ideas and feelings can be expressed on the WWW, allowing for open discourse about topics that might be difficult to express in person. 
Businesses can use the WWW to provide a marketplace away from a traditional store. This allows businesses to have access to customers from all over the world.
Economies can exchange data virtually instantly, providing a platform for trading that is important to ensure sustainability and consolidation. Markets connected in this manner can react to news instantly.
Overall, the WWW has become an essential part of the human experience and will carry-on into the foreseeable future.
